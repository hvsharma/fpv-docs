However, realizing that this is a great way to help budding drone builders in India to get started, we have decided to make this an open initiative. We welcome people who would like to contribute as they go along with their drone building projects. Help us build a knowledge base that a beginner would benefit most out of. This project aims to act as a starting point for all Indian drone builders and enthusiasts. We want this to be a simple, effective and useful guide for all people who are starting out with this hobby. Drone building can be an expensive hobby, and beginners need to make sure that they are not flushing their money down the drain by buying parts that are pricey yet not the best, popular yet incompatible, and sometimes, just plain wrong. Read this before you begin \u00b6 There are some important points to note before you begin using these docs: This project focuses mainly on FPV drones with a 5-inch form factor . These drones are super versatile, designed for either racing, video-making or freestyling. Click here to see an example of the kind of drones we build in this doc (freestyling type drone). Drone making needs a considerable amount of research and understanding . Some important concepts of physics (thrust, load, power to name a few) come into play early into the equation. We will try our best to make this document keeping beginners in mind. Note that we are beginners too when we started to write this document, and will no longer be when we are done with a full draft . Drone making can become an expensive hobby . Please be aware (with market conditions being as they are) that in India, drone enthusiasm is just picking up. Drone parts can become hard to find . There will be a lot of delays when procuring the right parts for the build and patience will be of paramount importance.

It houses all the components that make up the drone. Quadcopters usually have frames that are made of Carbon Fiber (smaller ones have plastic frames). These come in two main categories: lightweight compact frames designed for drone racing, and freestyle frames, which are usually slightly larger than racing frames, more durable and slightly heavier too. Choosing the right frame for your FPV drone \u00b6 There are a lot of things that we need to consider when selecting a frame for the drones. Let's discuss the main ones: Propeller Size - Depending on the length of the arms of the frame, specific propeller sizes will be needed. Most common are 5\" and 3\" propellers, and drone frames usually support them well. Usable Internal Space - When selecting a frame, we need to consider the space available inside the frame for mounting the components. Does the frame have the right mounting-holes? Does it come with the right amount of space for all the components we will be putting into it (FC, ESC, Camera, battery, radio, antenna, etc) Aerodynamics - How well does the drone slice through the air? Bulky drones tend to meet with higher air resistance and will need more power to fly through the air. A thin nimble frame will cut through much easier and with lesser effort. Strength - A strong frame will survive many crashes before it breaks apart. A lightweight frame, on the other hand would break apart a bit more easily as they dont have the strength to withstand heavy crashes or drops. However, this can be a double-edged sword - a stronger drone would be heavier, and would need more power to fly. So a balance would need to be struck between strength and weight. Frames with 4mm thick plates are pretty durable and strong (but slightly heavier too). Also, 3mm thick frames are also available but will not be quite as strong. Additional Features - Some well designed frames come with some extra features. For example, some come with overarching support rungs that protect the camera in case of a head-on collision. Others come with capabilities to mount additional cameras like GoPros. Yet others come with power distribution boards that allow you to properly distribute power from the ESC to the motors. We recommend beginners to go with freestyle 4mm thick 5\" frames instead of thinner racing-style frames, for obvious reasons Power Distribution Board (PDB) \u00b6 Power Distribution Boards (or PDBs) are circuit boards that help pass power from the drone battery to the various components of the drone. While these were very popular in recent times, many modern Flight Controllers (FC) come with a PDB inbuilt into the circuit, making a separate PDB unnecessary. These usually come with many frames, and can also be separately bought if required. In our build, we use a Flight Controller that already has an integrated PDB, and this component is not required.","title":"Frame"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-components/01-frame/_index.en/#frames","text":"The frame is the main body of the drone.

This is a piece of hardware that forms the heart of the drone. The FC is basically a mini computer that manages the way your drone flies. The flight controller usually has some firmware installed on it that allows it to make calculations and decisions by collecting telemetry and data from other parts of the drone and from sensors such as a gyro, GPS, accelerometers and more. The Flight Controller also connects to a radio receiver chip (RX) and accepts control input from the pilot who is flying the drone. It uses these radio signals from the RX to determine the way the pilot wants the drone to move, and makes it fly that way. The processing power of a flight controller determines the capabilities of the drone. An F4 is a common processor class that is a standard we see in many Flight Controllers today (example, the Mamba F405 comes with an F4 processor). F7 and H7 processor classes are more powerful and rapidly becoming the norm (example, Mamba F722 comes with a F7 processor). Categories of Flight Controllers \u00b6 The Flight Controllers come in various categories and are used for specific applications: Made for multi-rotors Made for fixed-wing RC Planes & Multipurpose FCs (Used for both winged RC planes as well as multi-rotors) All In One Flight Controllers \u00b6 Modern flight controllers typically come with many essential capabilities which would otherwise be separate components which we would need to connect together with cables. Known as All-in-One (AIO) Flight controllers, these come with PDB inbuilt (as explained before) and are capable of connecting with multiple different sensors and components. UARTS \u00b6 UARTS are basically universal ports that allow the Flight Controllers to control or work with more components or sensors.

' Let's take a look at the hobby drone-flying scene in India: What you should know \u00b6 The following rules apply irrespective of the category of the drone. If you own a drone (defined as an RPAS or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System on the site), you need to register it with the government. This is not optional and is a mandatory requirement. Drone regulations differ based on the total weight of your drone. Each drone category comes with it's own set of rules and regulations that we need to abide by. Registration can be done by logging on to the DGCA Digital Sky WebSite If you are planning to build a drone, or have a drone that you have built yourself, it still needs to be registered. Theres a section below that covers this scenario. Primary Regulations \u00b6 Here are the main rules that you need to be aware of: Drone pilots need to register their drones before they attempt to fly them. Drones must not be flown higher than 400ft vertically. Drone pilots must always maintain line-of-sight with their drones when flying them. Drones cannot be flown in no-fly zones (mostly places of national importance, military locations, airports, LoCs and so on). Drones should not be used to violate the privacy of others or to harm others in any way. Drone Categories \u00b6 The following are the different categories recognized by the DGCA as of this time of writing: Category Weight Classification Nano Less than or equal to 250 grams. Micro Greater than 250 grams and less than or equal to 2 kg. Small Greater than 2 kg and less than or equal to 25 kg. Medium Greater than 25 kg and less than or equal to 150 kg. Large Greater than 150 kg. Nano drones \u00b6 These are drones with All Up Weight (AUW) of 250 grams or less. AUW includes any payload that the drone may be carrying. At the time of writing, Nano drones do not have any restrictive rules governing its use in India. These drones do not need to be registered. Note that a nano drone will be bumped up to the micro category if it's speed exceeds 15 meters per second or if it can fly farther than 100m from the pilot. The drone will also be bumped up to Micro category if it can fly higher than 15 feet off the ground level. Since we are primarily focused on Micro drones, this document focuses on that category alone. Micro Drones \u00b6 UIN Number \u00b6 To fly micro drones, you need to register the drone as mentioned above, and you need to obtain a UIN (Unique Identification Number) for the drone. This UIN number needs to be clearly indicated on the body of the drone. NPNT \u00b6 This drone needs to comply with NPNT rule. NPNT stand for No Permission No TakeOff, which is a system that allows a drone to fly only if the drone pilot has been granted permission for a flight. This is a complicated requirement that requires your drone to have a GPS GLONASS chip and a SIM, allowing the drone be tracked and monitored. This particular regulation is pretty hard to achieve for us, and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption and support for this requirement in the drone building world. RTH System & GeoFencing Capabilities \u00b6 Drones in the Micro category need to be equipped with the automated capability to return back to the pilot if they enter restricted airspace (also known as Controlled Airspace) or places that they are not supposed to be flown into. This too is a complicated requirement for us to achieve and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption and support for this requirement in the drone building world. Flight Records and Logbooks \u00b6 Drone pilots are required to maintain clear and concise records of their flight sessions, including information about flight locations, flight time, and other flight metrics. This is a manual requirement that each pilot needs to adhere to and is not in scope for our document. What about a drone that you build yourself \u00b6 We intend to build our own drones instead of buying RTF (ready-to-fly) drones. In our case, our drone build is going to be in the micro category. The DGCA Digital Sky platform recognizes us as a drone manufacturer, and we need to register by operating under this assumption. Since we build our own drones, we will provide our own serial numbers for each drone we register. Thankfully, this is allowed and perfectly legal to do so.","title":"Drone Regulations in India"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-regulations-ind/_index.en/#drone-regulations-in-india","text":"Before we get into the basics of Drone Building, we need to understand what the Indian government thinks about it.

Drones should not be used to violate the privacy of others or to harm others in any way.","title":"Primary Regulations"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-regulations-ind/_index.en/#drone-categories","text":"The following are the different categories recognized by the DGCA as of this time of writing: Category Weight Classification Nano Less than or equal to 250 grams.

Large Greater than 150 kg.","title":"Drone Categories"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-regulations-ind/_index.en/#nano-drones","text":"These are drones with All Up Weight (AUW) of 250 grams or less. AUW includes any payload that the drone may be carrying. At the time of writing, Nano drones do not have any restrictive rules governing its use in India. These drones do not need to be registered. Note that a nano drone will be bumped up to the micro category if it's speed exceeds 15 meters per second or if it can fly farther than 100m from the pilot. The drone will also be bumped up to Micro category if it can fly higher than 15 feet off the ground level.
